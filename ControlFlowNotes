Control Flow Notes (Starting from exercise 3)


All var that have been declared are truthy unless they contain any of the following

False
0 and -0
"" and '' (Empty Strings)
null
undefined
NaN (Not a number)
--------------------------------------------

Equal ===
Not equal !==


Use = to assign value, use === to compare two different values
------------------------------------------
To say "Both must be true", we use &&

To say "Either can be true", we use ||
------------------------------------------

Everything from the review page 

Way to go! We just learned a lot of control flow concepts:

if/else statements make binary decisions and execute different code based on conditions.
All conditions are evaluated to be truthy or falsy.
We can add more conditional statements to if/else statements with else if.
switch statements make complicated if/else statements easier to read and achieve the same result.
The ternary operator (?) and a colon (:) allow us to refactor simple if/else statements.
Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, and >= can compare two variables or values.
After two values are compared, the conditional statement evaluates to true or false.
The logical operator && checks if both sides of a condition are truthy.
The logical operator || checks if either side is truthy.
The logical operator !== checks if the two sides are not equal.
An exclamation mark (!) switches the truthiness / falsiness of the value of a variable.
One equals symbol (=) is used to assign a value to a variable.
Three equals symbols (===) are used to check if two variables are equal to each other.
